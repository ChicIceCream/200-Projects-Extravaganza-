Summary = Copy article linkWhat is a large language model (LLM)?
A large language model (LLM) is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) program that can recognize and generate text, among other tasks.
Deep learning involves the probabilistic analysis of unstructured data, which eventually enables the deep learning model to recognize distinctions between pieces of content without human intervention.
From this, a deep learning model could conclude (correctly) that these characters are among the most likely to appear in English-language text.
Transformer models are able to learn context — especially important for human language, which is highly context-dependent.
